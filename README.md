100 Days of Android Developer is an challenge project I want to capture the moment that I learn to be an andriod developer for the next 100 days from scratch with no experience and knowlage about this path. I am commited to take this challenge for improve my skills, make learning habit, and push my boundaries.

#### My Daily Quest
1. Code a minimum of an hour every day (except saturday or sunday) for the next 100 days. (Work hours is not included)
2. Update my progress everyday on github.
#### My Exceptions
1. If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day.
2. If I have an emergencies day I will take a day off.
